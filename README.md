# Payment API Project

 This is a project to create a Payment API using the following technologies:

- Kotlin
- Spring Boot
- Java 21 (install using SDK Man)
- REST

For starters, it will be created a Mock API. Therefore, databases, events and complex business rules won't be used. 
However, this project will be improved by adding complexity and other technologies.
